function [wi] = pesobrutoagas (gamma, radioEsbeltez, bloqueCresta, i, t, ...
   ag, as)
% Description:
% Calculate the weight at the serial numbers of block toppling that They are subjected
% at the toppling failure among which are the sliding failure and the toppling failure.

% External sub-function(s) :bloqueCresta, ag, as.
%
% Input(s):
% gamma         =   Unit weight at the block toppling.
% radioEsbeltez =   Relationship between the height of the block in the slope crest
%                   and the width of the serial block toppling.
% bloqueCresta =    position at block at the slope crest wich means the
%                   change into cut slope and slope crown.
% i            =    serial number at all block toppling is to
%                   (1...nblocks).
% as           =    relationship between the angle of cut slope and the angle of principal
%                   fault line with respect at the imaginarious axis
%                   (X).
% ag           =    geometric relationship between the angle of slope crown and the
%                   angle of principal fault line with respect at the imaginarious axis (X).
% t =       blocks width of the serial of analisys.
%
% Output(s):
% wi          =   weight at the serial numbers of block toppling that They are subjected
% at the toppling failure among which are the sliding failure and the toppling failure.
