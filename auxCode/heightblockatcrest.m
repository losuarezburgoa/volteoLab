% External sub-function(s) :as.
%
% Input(s):
% as    =      relationship between the angle of cut slope and the angle of principal
%              fault line with respect at the imaginarious axis
%              (X).
% betaSr =     angle of cut slope with respect at the imaginarious horizontal axis (X).
% betaBs =     angle of cut slope with respect at the real horizontal axis (x).
% H =          Heigth at the slope calculated by the distance since the slope
%              toe to change of the cut and the slope crown.
%
% Output(s):
% hm =   the height at the block in the slope crestfor a set of toppling
%        blocks.

% Example 1
%[ hm ] = heightblockatcrest( 50, 75, 0.7465, 4.2662 )
% Answer: 
% radioEsbeltez =  2.1193
%
% Example 2
%[ hm ] = heightblockatcrest( 35, 60, 0.2550, 6.52)
% Answer: 
% radioEsbeltez =  1.57
%

hm = cos(betaSr*pi/180)/(sin(betaS*pi/180))*as*H;
