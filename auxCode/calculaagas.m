function [ag, as] = calculaagas (betaGr, betaSr, thetaR)
% Description:
% Calculate geometric relationship between the angle of slope crown and the
% angle of principal fault line with respect at the imaginarious axis (X),
% denominated (ag), and the relationship between the angle of cut slope and
% the angle of principal fault line with respect at the imaginarious axis
% (X), denominated (as).

% Input(s):
% betaGr = angle of slope crown with respect at the imaginarious axis (X).
% betaSr = angle of cut slope with respect at the imaginarious axis (X).
% thetaR = angle of principal fault line with respect at the imaginarious
%          axis (X).
%
% Output(s):
 
% Example 1
% [ ag, as ] =calculaagas( 16, 50, 24 );
%
% Answer:
% ag = -0.1585
% as = 0.5548
%
% Example 2
% [ ag, as ] =calculaagas( 16, 55, 24 );
%
% Answer:
% ag = -0.1585
% as = 0.9829
%
  ag = tan(deg2rad(betaGr)) - tan(deg2rad(thetaR));
  as = tan(deg2rad(betaSr)) - tan(deg2rad(thetaR));
