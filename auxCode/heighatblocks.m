function [ hi ] = heighatblocks( radioEsbeltez, bloqueCresta, posBloque, ag, as, t )
% Description:
% Calculate the heights at the serial numbers of block toppling that They are subjected
% at the toppling failure among which are the sliding failure and the toppling failure.

%
% External sub-function(s) :bloqueCresta, radioEsbeltez, ag, as.
%
% Input(s):
% radioEsbeltez =   Relationship between the height of the block in the slope crest
%                   and the width of the serial block toppling.
% bloqueCresta =    position at block at the slope crest wich means the
%                   change into cut slope and slope crown.
% posBloque    =    serial number at all block toppling is to
%                   (1...nblocks).
% as           =    relationship between the angle of cut slope and the angle of principal
%                   fault line with respect at the imaginarious axis
%                   (X).
% ag           =    geometric relationship between the angle of slope crown and the
%                   angle of principal fault line with respect at the imaginarious axis (X).
% t =       blocks width of the serial of analisys.
%
% Output(s):
% heighatblocks =   heights at the serial numbers of block toppling that They are subjected
%                   at the toppling failure among which are the sliding failure 
%                   and the toppling failure.
