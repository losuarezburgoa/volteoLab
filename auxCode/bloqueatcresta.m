% Description:
% Find the serial number at the block in the slope crest, wich is the point
% of the change between angle cut slope and the angle of slope crown

% External sub-function(s) :ag, as.
%
% Input(s):
% ag =      geometric relationship between the angle of slope crown and the
%           angle of principal fault line with respect at the imaginarious axis (X).
% betaB =   angle of the imaginarious axis (X) with the real horizontal axis
%           (x).
% betaSr =  angle of cut slope with respect at the imaginarious horizontal axis (X).
% betaBs =  angle of cut slope with respect at the real horizontal axis (x).
% as =      relationship between the angle of cut slope and the angle of principal
%           fault line with respect at the imaginarious axis
%           (X).
% H =       Heigth at the slope calculated by the distance since the slope
%           toe to change of the cut and the slope crown.
% t =       blocks width of the serial of analisys.
%
% Output(s):
% bloqueCresta = position at block at the slope crest wich means the
%                change into cut slope and slope crown.

% Example 1
% bloqueCresta =bloqueatcresta( -0.1585, 25, 50, 75, 0.7465, 4.2662, 0.40)
% Answer: bloqueCresta =20.
%
% Example 2
% bloqueCresta =bloqueatcresta(-0.1585, 25, 35, 60, 0.2550, 6.52, 0.40)
% Answer: bloqueCresta =12.

bloqueCresta =floor (1/(ag*tan(betaB*pi/180))-(cos(betaSr*pi/180)*as*H)/(sin(betaBs*pi/180)*ag*t)+1);
